# Web Image Scraper

This Python script allows you to scrape images from a webpage using ScrapingBee's API. It downloads images that meet a specified minimum size requirement, making it useful for collecting high-quality images from websites.

## Features

- Scrapes images from any specified webpage
- Uses ScrapingBee's API for efficient and reliable scraping
- Downloads only images that meet a minimum size requirement
- Handles various image formats including JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, and HEIF/HEIC
- Configurable output directory and minimum image size
- Command-line interface for easy use

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Docker installed on your system
- ScrapingBee API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script files.

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your ScrapingBee API key:
   ```
   SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   sudo docker build -t web-image-scraper .
   ```

## Usage

First, run the Docker container and access its bash shell:

```
sudo docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app -v $(pwd)/images:/app/images web-image-scraper bash
```

This command does the following:
- `-it`: Runs the container interactively
- `--rm`: Removes the container when it exits
- `-v $(pwd):/app`: Mounts the current directory to /app in the container
- `-v $(pwd)/images:/app/images`: Mounts the images directory
- `web-image-scraper`: The name of our Docker image
- `bash`: Runs the bash shell in the container

Once you're inside the container's bash shell, you can run the script using:

```
python main.py <url> [options]
```

### Arguments:

- `url`: The webpage URL to scrape (required)

### Options:

- `-o, --output`: Specify the output folder for downloaded images (default: "scraped_images")
- `-m, --min-area`: Specify the minimum image area in pixels (default: 50000)
- `-h, --help`: Show the help message and exit

### Example:

While inside the Docker container's bash shell:

```
python main.py https://www.ai21.com/blog/the-promise-of-rag-bringing-enterprise-generative-ai-to-life -o /app/images -m 50000
```

This will scrape images from the specified URL, save them to the `/app/images` directory (which is mounted to your host machine), and only keep images with an area of at least 50,000 pixels.

To exit the Docker container after you're done, simply type:

```
exit
```

This will return you to your host machine's shell.

## How It Works

1. The script uses ScrapingBee's API to fetch the HTML content of the specified URL.
2. It extracts all `<img>` elements from the HTML.
3. For each image found, it:
   - Attempts to download the image
   - Checks the image dimensions
   - If the image meets the minimum size requirement, it saves the image to the specified output folder
   - Skips images that are too small or fail to download
